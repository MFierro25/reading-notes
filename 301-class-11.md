## Video Notes:
#### What does SQL stand for?
- Structured Query Language
#### What is a realational database?

non-tabular databases
#### Howo does it work?
store data in documents rather than relational tables
#### What is inside of a Mongo database?
BSON documents

Mongo is more flexible since sql is more structured and requires schema
#### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
cant rely on records or schemas, there are no or few relations so its hard to update.
