## Forms
What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

> An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
> we should update as soon as response is entered so other react elements have the changes applied as well.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator?
> to simplify our if else statements

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
```
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
 ```
 
 reworked :
 
 ```
 (x === y) ? true : false
 ```
