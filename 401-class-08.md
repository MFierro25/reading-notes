## List Comprehensions
Example of using range()
```
digits = [x for x in range(10)]

print(digits)

output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
first 'x' = expresssion
second 'x' = each item being created

you can also add filters to list comprehensions, the code below is a list compresion to only get even numbers from 0-20
```
even_numbers = [ x for x in range(1,20) if x % 2 == 0]
```
some examples for list comprehesnions are :
1. to show first letter of every word
2. seperating the letters in a string
3. change a letters case 
4. print numbers in string isdigit()
5. parsing a file 
6. using functions


## Decorators
a decorator is : 'A function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it'

functions inside another are inner functions
if you return a function without the parentheses then you are returning a reference to the function, if it has parentheses then calling the result of evaluating the function
>  decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior

Python allows you to use decorators in a simpler way with the @ symbol, or in other words the “pie” syntax

decorators can be re-used as modules
