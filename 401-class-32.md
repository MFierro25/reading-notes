# Drf Permission
- permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access
- Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes
- When the permission checks fail, either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned

AllowAny: <br>
allows unrestricted access

IsAuthenticated:  <br>
deny permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise

IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly:  <br>
allow authenticated users to perform any request. Requests for unauthorised users will only be permitted if the request method is one of the "safe" methods; GET, HEAD or OPTIONS

IsAdmin: <br>
deny permission to any user, unless user.is_staff is True
