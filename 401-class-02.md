## TDD with Python
TDD = test driven development
  - writes test firsts
  -  test file name should follow the same name of module name <br>
  
AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.
  - Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
  - Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
  - Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

Cycle :
  1. write a test that fails (has to fail)
  2. Write the feature and make the test pass
  3. Refactor code
## If name equals main
>  __name__ variable is used whether you want a file that can be run as the main program or imported by other modules. We can use an if __name__ == "__main__" block to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported
## Recursion
> process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly
 ```
 int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```
- Need a base condition to be met. then solution is is expressed in smaller problems
- A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function

ADVANTAGES
1. The code may be easier to write.
2. To solve such problems which are naturally recursive
3. Reduce unnecessary calling of function.
4. Extremely useful when applying the same solution.
5. Recursion reduce the length of code
6. It is very useful in solving the data structure problem

DISADVANTAGES
1. Recursive functions are generally slower than non-recursive function.
2. may require a lot of memory space to hold intermediate results on the system stacks.
3. Hard to analyze or understand the code.
4. It is not more efficient in terms of space and time complexity.
