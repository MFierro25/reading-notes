## Pain and Suffering
i have to remind myself these 4 questions:
```
Whatâ€™s my perspective?
Why am i doing this?
Do i want what comes at the end of this journey?
am i doing this for me?
```
i am doing this for my own growth and development and this 'pain' is temporary
## Beginners Guide to Big O
#### Big O Notation is a way to measure an algorithm's efficiency. It measures the time it takes to run your function as the input grows
O(1) - algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of input <br>
O(N) - algorithm whose performance will grow linearly to the size of the input data set. <br>
O(N<sup>2</sup>) - algorithm whose performancve is directly proportional to the square of the size of input data. <br>
O(2^N) - algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set ( exponential growth) 

## Names and Values in Python
- names are reassigned independently,
- values live until no references 
```
x = 'hello'
x = 'world'
hello is forgotten and now world gets called
```
- assignment never copies data 
```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
other = nums 
this is referrring to the same list. there is not two different lists
```
- immutable types : ints, floats. strings, tuples ( these values cannot be changed ) 
- changing an int: rebinding
- changing a list : mutating
