## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.
Couple of takeaways from the speech:
- understand just cus im not there yet doesnt mean i wont get there.
- fixed mindset is set on now, tend to cheat or run from difficulty
- growth is focusing in the process and the challenge
- fixed - no brain activity doesnt engange
- growth - abilities can be developed and become enganged
- praise the process and not the result
- mindsets can be changed

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
> "grit is passion and perseverance for certain goals" grit is needed to push through and work past challenges. not much is known to understand how to build grit or measure grit. something that has been shown though is that grit can be directly correleate with a growth mindset. we need to be tested, we need to fail and we need to build grit.
## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.
> success needs to be measured by ourselves and in order to be succesful is to make sure its our own success, that it is something we want and desire and not what others deem to be success.  

## emotional intelligence results :
> after seeing my scores i realized i had over 20 in 3 out of the four and only had one where i was lacking. It just assured what i already had an idea that i have high self and social awareness and the one thing i need to work on is my relationship managment. I already had a feeling this was an aspect to work on but just seeing this confirms my thoughts.

## Biases Assesment :
> even though i have been raised in a multicultural family and have grown up with many friends from different backgrounds i learned that i also have room for growth. I was honest with my answers and didnt score as high as i would have thought. it shows there is more room for growth for me and also something to always be concious about.
