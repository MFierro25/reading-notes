# React Part 2

## conditional rendering
"you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need"

## Forms
text area tag - element defines its text by its children
select tag -  creates a drop-down list
file input - lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded

## Lifting state up
> rely on "top down data flow"

## Composition vs Inheritance
"Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way."

## thinking in React
Steps:
1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
2. Build A Static Version in React
3. Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
4. Identify Where Your State Should Live
5. Add Inverse Data Flow
