#### What Google Learned About Teams

> there were many takeaways from the reading but for the most part google spent plenty of money to come up with a finding that realizes that teams that trust each other and build connections for the most part work better together. There are many different aspects that lead to a better team but for the most part when people feel comfortablem included and open with their team the better they work. This makes sense since when i think of myself and what type of work environment i would like to be a part of i would want to work somewhere that i look forward to be at instead of somewhere i feel judged. This also seems true for others,when they are at a job that they feel comfortable in then they focus on work and being productive instead of worryibng about other aspects in life. There was also findings showing that when there is a team where everyone is closer to equals the better the overall outcome is. These teams work better and produce more compared to teams where there is one person barking orders.
