## Classes and Objects
Objects:
- are compiled of variables and functions into a single entity.
-  get their variables and functions from classes.
CLasses :
- a template to create your objects.
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```
> The __init__() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for asigning values in a class


## Thinking Recursively
recursive function :
  a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
  ```
  def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
  ```
## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage
Fixtures:
> pytest fixtures are functions attached to the tests which run before the test function is executed. 

Coverage:
>Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not.
