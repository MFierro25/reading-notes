## Read and Write Files in Python
Files:
1. Header - metadata about the contents of the file 
2. Data -  contents of the file
3. End Of File - special character that indicates the end

File Path:
1. path -  file folder location on the file system
2. name - actual name 
3. extension - end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

openining a file in python
```
file = open('file_name.txt')
```
Closing a file
```
with open('file_name.txt') as reader:
```
appending a file
```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'a') as a_writer:
    a_writer.write('\nBeagle')
```
## Exceptions
Exception - This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error

Some Examples:
-  ArithmeticError
    > The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various arithmetic errors: OverflowError, ZeroDivisionError, FloatingPointError
- BufferError
  > Raised when a buffer related operation cannot be performed
- LookupError
  > raised when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid: IndexError, KeyError
Example :
```
x = 10
if x > 5:
    raise Exception('x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: {}'.format(x))
```
Output:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 4, in <module>
Exception: x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: 10
```
> Instead of waiting for a program to crash midway, you can also start by making an assertion in Python. We assert that a certain condition is met. If this condition turns out to be True,  The program can continue. If the condition turns out to be False, you can have the program throw an AssertionError exception.

```
try -> run this code 
except -> execute THIS code when theres an exception
else -> if no exceptions, run this
finally - > ALWAYS run this
```
