## Dunder methods
Dunder methods - predefined methods for classes that start and end with 'double underscores'

some examples:
```
- __init__ = used to construct an object 
- __repr__ / __str__ = string representation of object
- __len__ = to get length
- __reversed__ = iterate over object in reverse
- __add__ = merging 
- __call__ = makes an object callable
```
> in python everything is an object

## Statistics
> the chance of something happening, the more you do something the better the data is and provides better calculations for probability. 

#### central limit theroem 
- when random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution 
- 
#### three sigma rule 
- statistical calculation where the data are within three standard deviations from the middle or average
  - usually 68, 95, and 99.7
> Z equation = z = (x-μ)/σ
" the z score is a useful statistic. it allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within the normal distribution and allows us to compare two scores that are from different normal distributions
