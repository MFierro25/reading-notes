## Scope
L. local - code block or body of any Python function, created at function call, not at function definition <br>
E. enclosing -  exists for nested functions, contains the names that you define in the enclosing function <br>
G. global - top-most scope,  visible from everywhere in your code <br>
B. built in -  scope thatâ€™s created or loaded whenever you run a script <br>

Global scope - variables here are used throughout the whole code
Local scope - only available to code within the scope

| Operation   |      statement      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| assignment |    x = "some value"   |
| import | import Module |
| function |    def function_name   |
| class | class Global |

> " where you assign or define a name in your code determines the scope or visibility of that name." 

local : variable gets set inside a function

global : set outside of ALL functions

dictionaries = namespaces ( __dict__ )
> with dictionary you can either use dot notation or subscription operation to call the name

## Modify 

> use two key words to modify scopes, global and nonlocal

```
def update_counter():
...     global counter  # Declare counter as global
...     counter = counter + 1  # Successfully update the counter
```
the "global' in the function makes it available globally
