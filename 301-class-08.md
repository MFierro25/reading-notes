## API Best practices 

#### What does REST stand for?
- Representational State Transfer
#### REST APIs are designed around a ____.
- RESOURCES : which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
#### What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.
 - a URI that identifies that resource ex. "https://adventure-works.com/orders/1"
#### What are the most common HTTP verbs?
1. GET - used to retrieve data from the server
2. POST - sends data to the server and creates a new resource
3. PUT - used to update an existing resource
4. PATCH - modifies existing resource, the request body contains the specific changes to the resource, specifically a set of instructions describing how that resource should be changed
5. DELETE -used to delete a resource specified by its URI
#### What should the URIs be based on?
- should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).
#### Give an example of a good URI.
``` 
https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid
```
#### What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
-  all web requests impose a load on the web server. The more requests, the bigger the load. so a chatty web API is bad, 
#### What status code does a successful GET request return?
> HTTP status code 200 (OK)
#### What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
> 404 (Not Found)
#### What status code does a successful POST request return?
> HTTP status code 201 (Created)
#### What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
> HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
