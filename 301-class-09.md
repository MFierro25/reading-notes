## Functional Programming Concepts

#### What is functional programming?
> A style of building the structure and elements of compouter programs, it treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data
#### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- Pure Function: take some input and return some output based on that input. They are the simplest reusable building blocks of code in a program.
1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
2. It does not cause any observable side effects
#### What are the benefits of a pure function?
Benefits:
- readability 
- portablitity
- testing
- caching

#### What is immutability?
> when something cannot be changed, state cannot be changed after its created
#### What is Referential transparency?
``` 
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
```

#### What is a module?
> software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines, it consists a single block of code that can be invoked in the way that a procedure, function, or method is invoked
#### What does the word ‘require’ do?
> used to load and cache JavaScript modules
#### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
using require in the file you want to import to
#### What do we have to do to make a module available?
by "module.export = "
