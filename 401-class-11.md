## Numpy
a 2 dimensional array = matrix(has rows and columns)

use numpy.array function to create a matrix 
below is example on how to get started 
```
Import the numpy package
Pass the list of lists into the array function, which converts it into a NumPy array.
Exclude the header row with list slicing.
Specify the keyword argument dtype to make sure each element is converted to a float
```

Shape : check the number of rows and columns in data

types of numpy creation:
  - all zeroes, to createa a matrix with a fixed size but no values inside yet
  - create an array where each element is a random number
  - use NumPy to directly read csv or other files into arrays

examples of slicing a numpy array 
```
data[0:3,3] - selects starting index up to 3rd index
data[:,3] - selects entire 4th column by omitting first 0
data[:,:] - returns entire data
```
