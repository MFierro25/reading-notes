## NextJs
things needed to build a react app
- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack 
- need to do production optimizations such as code splitting
-  pre-render some pages for performance and SEO
-  connect your React app to your data store.

> A framework such as ReactJs takes care of these issues

common features include but not limited to:
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR)
- code splitting
- Built-in CSS and Sass support
- API routes to build API endpoints

## React Context for Beginners
> "React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props"

types of data that can be passes:
- theme
- user
- location

> Data should be placed on React context that does not need to be updated often, this is because it is not made as a data management system. instead it is used to store data, think of it like global variables

#### steps
1. Create "createContext" method
2. wrap the context provider around your component tree
3. Put any value you like on your context provider using the "value" prop
4. Read that value within any component
