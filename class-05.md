#### Chapter 5: “Images” 
> good practice is to keep all photos in a seperate folder
three things are neded to add a picture
- IMG - this is the tag used
- SRC - tells browser where photo is located
- alt - text description of photo
- title - this is used to add addtl info of photo
> Can be placed, before, inside, or after a paragraph, each affects how image is displayed

#### Chapter 11: “Color” 
Three ways to specify color
- RGB values
- Hex Values
- Color names
attributes of color that can be edited include
- contrast
- opacity
- hue, saturation, lightness

#### Chapter 12: “Text” 
Just like elements, text can be edited or personalized as well. it can be bold, italics, stretched etc... 
you can go deeper and edit, text align, spacing and shadows.
>a thing to remember is each system (Mac / Windows) shows typefaces different so it is good idea how it will turn out.
