## random module
randint - produces two random integers, a low and a high
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
```
this will produce a number between 1-5

Choice - Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
```
random.choice( ['car', 'home', 'boat'] ).
```
this will choose one of these random elements

## Risk Analysis
Risk Identification -> Risk Assesment -> Risk Analysis

Types of risks:

- High = the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable
- Medium = it is tolerable but not desirable.
- Low =  it is tolerable. 

Risks identification : Business, testing, premature release, software
> to mitigate the problem of an unwanted incident, you first have to identify possible risks assign them their possible category and finally test.

## Test Coverage
> testing can be misleading when you are just aiming for high codebase numbers. this is attained by putting in many useless tests that just pass anything and are not providing a meaningful test.

Instead focus on these 2 :
- You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
