## Docker

basics
- doesnâ€™t matter if you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer anymore
- entire development environment is isolated: 
    - programming language
    - software packages 
    - databases
- no virtual Env
- can be shared among team members

downside:
 - complexity 

containers vs venv
> venv can only isolate python packages. a global install is still required, venv are more limited than containers. containers are light weight. 

## Django For Api's
> cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework; it always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured

django:
- creates websites containing webpages

Django REST:
- creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.
- added like any third party app
