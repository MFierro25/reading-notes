## Thinking in React
What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
> a component should only do 1 thing and once it starts doing more than that then it should be broken into subcompnents

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
> build out the app with no interactitivy or working functions. dont add any state

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
> next add the minimal amount of stae reaquired

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
1.Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2.Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3.Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

How can you identify where state needs to live?
> Find a common owner component, 
Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

## Order Functions
What is a “higher-order function”?
Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, 

Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
it is returning the items with greatest first

Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
map - transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values
reduce - builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value
