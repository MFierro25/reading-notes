1. Mounting (which includes the following in order)
  1.static
  2.getDerivedStateFromProps
  3. render
  4. componentDidMount
  5. UNSAFE_componentwillMount

#### Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

#### What does componentDidMount do?
 when you want to use a network request or initialize a DOM you place it here. This allows us to execute the react code.

#### What types of things can you pass in the props?
- initial count
- title and subtitle
- static information


#### What is the big difference between props and state?
Props are passed into the component meaning they are handled <em> outside </em> the component while states are handled <em> inside </em> the component. A prop is more like a variable while a state is there when we need to re-render or update the app.

#### When do we re-render our application?
when the user does something or something needs to be changed is when we re-render. 

#### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- updating count
- things to update app.
- things that change
