#  Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server
>  the server started with runserver is not guaranteed to be performant (it’s very slow), and it hasn’t been built with security concerns in mind. Not a good fit for production use, If you want to run Django in production, be sure to use a production-ready web server like Nginx
