## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking & Caesar Cipher
"The Caesar Cipher replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount"

3 ways used to decipher message:

- frequency analysis
- known plaintext
- brute force

frequency: since "e" is one of the most common letters looking at a message you can most likely guess the most common one is "E"

plaintext: most messages started the same way so this was a good hint to how to decypher the message 

brute force: only 25 possible shifts, try until one word makes sense

<b> encryption
  - scrambling the data or message
  
<b> decryption 
  - recovering the data using the secret key\
  
<b> code cracking 
  - not knowing the key but using ways to ocrack the data
