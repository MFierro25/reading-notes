## dynamic routes
Development v.s. Production:
- In development (npm run dev), getStaticPaths runs on every request.
- In production, getStaticPaths runs at build time.

> If fallback is false, then any paths not returned by getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page.

If fallback is true:

- paths returned will be rendered to HTML at build time.
- paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page
- Next.js will serve a “fallback” version of the page on the first request to such a path
- Next.js will statically generate the requested path

## deployment
