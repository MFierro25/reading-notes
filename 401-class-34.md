# Django Settings best practice

common issues:
- Different environments
- sensitive data 
- sharing settings between team members
- settings are python code

# SSH
> "Secure shell"  is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.

The SSH command consists of 3 distinct parts:
```
ssh {user}@{host}
```
different encryption techniques:
- symmetrical :  a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host
- asymetrical: uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key
- hashing: they are never meant to be decrypted
